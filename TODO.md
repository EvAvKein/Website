### Tasks:
* **Convert API to TypeScript**: Impossible due to a tsconfig issue with Vercel which I was unable to locate. This task is not urgent, and checking/debugging it locally with `vercel dev` isn't possible anymore since SvelteKit switched to Vite and the Vercel CLI still uses the old commands... so I'm waiting until Vercel gets updated, in which case I'll create a repro to either discover the tsconfig issue is fixed, retry debugging the issue myself, or submit a GitHub issue.
