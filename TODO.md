- **Refine site theme**: I like the design concept of pseudo-physical blueprint papers, but the site's current theme is lurid. I need to find some way (perhaps with your help!) to make it less maximalist and intensely-colorful... without capitulating to the trending ultra-minimalist (I'll spare you the pejoratives) style I'm so tired of.
