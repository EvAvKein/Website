# EvAvKein Website
This is the repo for my (Eve Aviv Keinan's) website, hosted at https://evavkein.com

## Contributions
I welcome contributions (preferably brought up through GitHub issues first), such as:  
- Bug fixes
- Vulnerability fixes
- Formatting changes to comply with best practices (but I reserve the right to dismiss those on a subjective basis, as this project is meant to represent me with subjectivity included)
